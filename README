                             Data::Pipeline 0.01

                toolkit for building data processing pipelines

INSTALLATION
    Installation follows standard Perl CPAN module installation steps:

     cpan> install Data::Pipeline

    or, if not using the CPAN tool, then from within the unpacked
    distribution:

     % perl Makefile.PL
     % make
     % make test
     % make install

WHAT IS INSTALLED?

    Data::Pipeline - the Perl modules that make everything work

    data-pipeline - a DSL for describing data pipelines

DESCRIPTION

    The Data::Pipeline package consists of a set of modules, a parser, and
    a script engine for running data processing pipelines.  For more
    information, see http://dh.tamu.edu/drw/codex/Data_Pipeline_Scripting

BUGS
    There are probably quite a few. Certain machine features don't work as
    expected. There has been no profiling or optimization, so the pipelines
    will run much slower than they should. The interface design should be
    good though.

    Bugs may be reported on rt.cpan.org or by e-mailing bug-Data-Pipeline at
    rt.cpan.org.
